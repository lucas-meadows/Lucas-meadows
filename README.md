# Hi, I'm Lucas Meadows

I'm a undergraduate student at Columbia University studying Applied Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. In my free time I like to explore both financial and betting markets, and have enjoyed building quantitative models and data driven tools that combine market intuition with clean execuation and thoughtful modelling, prioritising interpretability and actionable insights over unnecessary complexity.

I'm currently working to improve the data pipeline for my UFC projects. The goal is to incorporate time-varying fighter statistics and merge them seamlessly with live-updating betting market data. This enhancement would significantly expand the dataset and improve the model granularity, perhaps ofering more nuanced pattern recognition, and giving the model greater predictive capabilities. It does, however, introduce some new challenges, most notably a heightened risk of data leakage due to the comopelxity of aligning asynchronous time series data from numerous sources. I am most focused of designing a robust pipeline that carefully manages these risks, after which I can focus on more dynamic and realistic modelling.

Please reach out if you are keen to collaborate on any projects, I would love to learn from others as much as I can.
